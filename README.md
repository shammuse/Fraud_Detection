# Fraud-Detection for E-commerce and Banking Transaction
This project develops machine learning models to detect fraud in e-commerce and banking transactions for Adey Innovations Inc. It leverages geolocation analysis and transaction patterns to improve accuracy, reduce financial losses, and enable real-time fraud monitoring.

## Core Objectives
This project will involve:
- Analyzing and preprocessing transaction data.
- Creating and engineering features that help identify fraud patterns.
- Building and training machine learning models to detect fraud.
- Evaluating model performance and making necessary improvements.
- Deploying the models for real-time fraud detection and setting up monitoring for continuous improvement.
  
## Project structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **.github/workflows/**: Configuration files for GitHub Actions to enable continuous integration (CI) and automated testing.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and preliminary modeling.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and fraud detaction model implementation.
- **tests/**: Unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the model and data processing logic.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies and libraries required for the project setup.
- **README.md**: Main documentation file with an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
